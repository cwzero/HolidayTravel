We are aware that mistakes can happen, so we created back buttons which return the user to the main menu screen.
In subsequent screens, we could include a main menu button that goes all the way back in addition to back buttons returning

We kept the interface consistent in terms of option order with create, change, delete buttons in that order and remained
consistent with the original design.
